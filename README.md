# galapagos
Galapagos is a DevOps Self-Service Software for Apache Kafka, including an opinionated approach on how to use Kafka for event-driven enterprise architecture.

## Demo Setup

[Demo Setup](docs/Demo%20Setup.md)

## Status

Currently (Oct 2020), the Galapagos Source Code is being prepared by Hermes Germany for getting Open Source. Feel free to watch this project to be informed as soon as the source code and installation / demo packages are available. We plan to push the source code in December 2020.

In the meantime, you can already study the "theoretical basis" of the Galapagos approach: See [Event-Driven Architecture Principles](event_driven_architecture_principles.md) for our principles for an Enterprise-wide Event-Driven Architecture, and [Kafka Guidelines](kafka_guidelines.md) for the guidelines for Kafka usage which result directly from these principles. Galapagos is our tool to "enforce" these Guidelines, while not putting additional burden on DevOps teams.
