# Galapagos Frontend

This folder contains the Angular based frontend for Galapagos, which is automatically bundled into the application by
the `pom.xml` in the root directory.

This frontend is based on the great Angular / Bootstrap Template **SB Admin Angular**, see
[SB Admin Angular](https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin-angular).

To start the Frontend during development, just run `npm run start` or `ng start` (if you have Angular CLI installed).
